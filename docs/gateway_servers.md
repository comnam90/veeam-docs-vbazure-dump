# Gateway Servers


A gateway server is an auxiliary backup infrastructure component that provides access between the backup server and repositories added to the backup infrastructure. By default, the role of a gateway server is assigned to the backup server.

Gateway servers cache data during backup copy and application restore operations, which helps you decrease the amount of traffic being sent over the network and reduce data transfer costs. For more information, see the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Cache](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/external_repository_cache.html?ver=13).
