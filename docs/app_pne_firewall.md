| To allow access from virtual networks to storage accounts, Microsoft Azure uses virtual network service endpoints. If any of the selected networks do not have virtual network service endpoints enabled for Microsoft.Storage.Global, Microsoft Azure will raise a warning. In this case, click Enable and wait for the process to complete. For more information on virtual network service endpoints, see [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview). |
