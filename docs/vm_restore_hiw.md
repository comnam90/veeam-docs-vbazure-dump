# VM Restore


Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure offers the following restore options:

* [VM restore](vm_restore_entire_hiw.md) — restores an entire Azure VM from a cloud-native snapshot or an image-level backup. You can restore one or more Azure VMs at a time, to the original location or to a new location.
* [Disk restore](vm_restore_disk_hiw.md) — restores virtual disks attached to an Azure VM from a cloud-native snapshot or an image-level backup. You can restore virtual disks to the original location or to a new location.
* [File-level restore](vm_restore_flr_hiw.md) — restores individual files and folders of an Azure VM from a cloud-native snapshot or an image-level backup. You can download the necessary files and folders to a local machine, or restore the files and folders of the source Azure VM to the original location.

You can restore Azure VM data to the most recent state or to any available restore point.
