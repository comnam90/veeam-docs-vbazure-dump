In this article

While performing configuration backup, Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure exports data from the configuration database and saves it to a backup file in a backup repository. You can back up the configuration database of a backup appliance either manually or automatically.

| Important |
| If your backup appliance is managed by a Veeam Backup & Replication server, you will neither be able to perform manual or scheduled configuration backup of Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure using the Web UI, nor to export the configuration data from the Web UI. In this case, you can perform configuration backup using the Veeam Backup & Replication console as described in section [Performing Configuration Backup Using Console](configuration_backup_console.md). |
