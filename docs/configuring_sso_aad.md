Step 4. Create Claim for Microsoft Entra application

To authenticate a user whose identity is received from the identity provider, Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure redirects the user to the identity provider portal. After the user logs in to the portal, the identity provider sends a SAML authentication response to Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure. The SAML response must contain an attribute whose value will be used by Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure to identify the user. The attribute value must match the user name that you specify when creating the user account.

For the identity provider to send the required attribute in the SAML authentication response, you must create a claim on the identity provider side and specify username as the outgoing claim name:

1. In the Single sign-on window of your Microsoft Entra application, locate the Attributes & Claims section and click Edit.
2. Click Add new claim.
3. In the Manage claim window, specify the following settings:

1. In the Name field, enter Username.
2. In the Choose name format section, select the Attribute option. In the Source attribute field, enter user.userprincipalname.
3. Click Save.

2. Click Download.
