# Rescanning Appliances


If a backup appliance become unavailable, for example, due to connectivity problems, you can rescan the appliance:

1. In the Veeam Backup & Replication console, open the Backup Infrastructure view.
2. Navigate to Managed Servers.
3. Select the necessary backup appliance and click Rescan appliance on the ribbon.

Alternatively, you can right-click the appliance and select Rescan.

1. In the opened window, click Yes.

Veeam Backup & Replication will remove all data collected from the appliance configuration database. Then, Veeam Backup & Replication will recollect session results for the past 24 hours, as well as information on all created snapshots, backups and policies.
