To simplify data protection and monitor compliance with your target SLA, Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure introduces SLA-based backup policies. An SLA-based backup policy is a collection of settings that automate the way backup operations are performed: how frequently to run the backup process, what region-specific repositories to use to store backups, how many restore points should be created in time to meet SLA requirements, and so on.

To help you eliminate error-prone manual steps and save time configuring SLA-based backup policies, Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure offers 2 types of templates:

* [SLA template](sla_template_hiw.md) — includes a periodic backup schedule and a target SLA value that you can use to define protection settings for workloads processed by SLA-based backup policies.
* [Storage template](storage_template_hiw.md) — includes backup storage settings and region-specific storage options that you can use to define target locations for backups created by SLA-based backup policies.

| Notes |
| * In Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure version 8.1, you can use SLA-based backup policies to protect Azure VMs only. * Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure prioritizes SLA-based backup policies over schedule-based backup policies. If an Azure VM is included into both a schedule-based and an SLA-based backup policy, it will be processed by the SLA-based backup policy only. |

For more information on different types of backup policies, see [Protecting Azure VMs](overview_vm.md).
