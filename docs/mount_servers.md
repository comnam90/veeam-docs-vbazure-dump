# Mount Servers


A mount server is an auxiliary backup infrastructure component that provides access between the backup server and repositories added to the backup infrastructure. By default, the role of a mount server is assigned to the backup server.

Veeam Backup & Replication uses mount servers to mount backed-up VM disks, access data stored on these disks and then copy the data to restore locations, which helps you decrease the amount of traffic being sent over the network and reduce data transfer costs. For more information, see the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Mount Servers](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/mount_server.html?ver=13).
