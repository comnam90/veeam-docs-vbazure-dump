After you install Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure and [add backup appliances](adding_appliance_console.md) to the backup infrastructure, you will be able to back up and restore Azure resources using both the Veeam Backup & Replication console and the Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure Web UI.

Accessing Veeam Backup & Replication Console

The Veeam Backup & Replication console is a client-side component of the backup infrastructure that provides access to the backup server. The console allows you to log in to Veeam Backup & Replication and to perform data protection and disaster recovery operations on the server. To learn how to access the Veeam Backup & Replication console, see the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Logging in to Veeam Backup & Replication](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/logon_to_console.html?ver=13).

By default, the Veeam Backup & Replication console is installed on the backup server automatically when you install Veeam Backup & Replication. However, in addition to the default console, you can install the Veeam Backup & Replication console on a dedicated machine to access the backup server remotely. To learn how to install Veeam Backup & Replication console, see the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Installing Veeam Backup & Replication Console](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/install_console.html?ver=13).
