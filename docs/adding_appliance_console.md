In this article

After you install Veeam Plug-in for Microsoft Azure, you must add backup appliances to the backup infrastructure. To do that, use either of the following options:

* [Deploy new backup appliances](deploying_appliance.md) from the Veeam Backup & Replication console.
* [Connect to existing backup appliances](connecting_appliance_console.md) if you have already deployed them as described in section [Deploying Backup Appliance](deploying_appliance.md).

| Note |
| One backup appliance can be managed by one backup server only. If you add the appliance to the backup infrastructure of another backup server, the synchronization between the appliance and the previous backup server will be terminated, and appliance will be displayed as unavailable. |
