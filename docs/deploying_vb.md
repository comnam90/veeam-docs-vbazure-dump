To deploy Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure, do the following:

1. Deploy the backup server as described in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Installing Veeam Backup & Replication](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/install_vbr.html?ver=120).

Alternatively, you can use a backup server that already exists in your backup infrastructure if it meets the Veeam Plug-in for Microsoft Azure [system requirements](system_requirements.md).

1. [Install Veeam Plug-in for Microsoft Azure on the backup server](installing_plug_in.md).

This step applies only to Veeam Backup & Replication versions prior to 12. Version 12 (and later) comes with Veeam Plug-in for Microsoft Azure pre-installed by default.

1. [Deploy a backup appliance in Microsoft Azure](deploying_appliance.md).
