In this article

A storage template is a collection of settings that allows you to define target locations (that is, repositories where Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure keeps restore points produced by SLA-based backup policies) for backups and archived backups. One storage template can be assigned to one or more SLA-based backup policies. For more information, see [Storage Templates](storage_template_hiw.md).
