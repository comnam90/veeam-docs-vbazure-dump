# Ports


As Veeam Plug-in for Microsoft Azure is installed on the same machine where Veeam Backup & Replication runs, it uses the same ports as those described in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Ports](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/used_ports.html?ver=13). In addition, Veeam Plug-in for Microsoft Azure also uses ports listed in the following table.

| Tip |
| To allow inbound access to an Azure service, you can use the IP address, DNS name or [virtual network service tag](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview) of the service. If you want to use an IP address, you can download a .JSON file with the full list of Azure IP ranges and service tags from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=56519). |

| Azure Storage service (service tag: Storage) | TCP/HTTPS | 443 | Required to access Azure storage accounts, and to communicate with worker instances using the Azure Queue Storage messaging service.  If you plan to protect Windows-based Azure VMs, this port is also required to use the Azure Queue Storage messaging service to communicate with Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) agents installed on source Azure VMs with enabled guest processing option. For more information, see [Performing Backup](vm_guest_processing.md#limit). |
| Azure Key Vault service (service tag: AzureKeyVault) | TCP/HTTPS | 443 | Required to encrypt backup repositories using cryptographic keys. |
| Azure Virtual Network service  (service tag: VirtualNetwork) | TCP/HTTPS | 443 | Required to communicate with storage accounts where Veeam applications and scripts are stored.  Note: This connection is required to back up Azure resources that operate in private environments only. |
| nginx web server (DNS name: nginx.org) | TCP/HTTPS | 443 | Required to upgrade the backup appliance. |
| Azure Cost Management service  (DNS name: apim-ratecard-v1.azure-api.net) | TCP/HTTPS | 443 | Required to calculate estimated costs for backup policies. |

Note: The usage of the specified TCP ports depends on the networking settings of SQL Servers. If the Redirect option is selected, port 1433 is used to establish only the first connection. If the Proxy option is selected, port 1433 is used to establish all connections by default. For more information on networking settings of SQL Servers, see [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-settings?view=azuresql&tabs=azure-portal#change-the-connection-policy). |
