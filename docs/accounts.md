# Managing Accounts


To perform data protection and disaster recovery operations, and to add objects to Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure, you must first create the following types of accounts:

* [Service accounts](service_accounts.md) — to get access to Azure resources that you want to protect.
* [SMTP and Database accounts](accounts_smtp_database.md) — to authenticate against SMTP servers and Azure databases.
