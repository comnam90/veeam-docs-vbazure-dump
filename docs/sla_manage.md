An SLA template is a collection of settings that allows you to protect your data according to a periodic backup schedule (regularly, within a backup window) in a way the data protection complies with SLA standards in your company. One SLA template can be assigned to one or more SLA-based backup policies. For more information, see [SLA Templates](sla_template_hiw.md).
