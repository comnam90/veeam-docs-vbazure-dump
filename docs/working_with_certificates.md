To establish secure data communications between the backup appliance and web browsers running on user workstations, Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates.

When you install Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure, it automatically generates a default self-signed certificate. You can replace this default certificate with your own self-signed certificate or with a certificate obtained from a Certificate Authority (CA). To replace the currently used TLS certificate, do the following:

1. Switch to the Configuration page.
2. Navigate to General > Certificates.
3. Click Replace Web Certificate.
4. Complete the New Web Server Certificate (HTTPS) wizard:

1. At the Certificate type step of the wizard, do the following:

* Select the Create a new certificate automatically option if you want to replace the existing certificate with a new self-signed certificate automatically generated by Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure.
* Select the Upload certificate option if you want to upload a certificate that you obtained from a CA or generated using a 3rd party tool.

1. [Applies only if you have selected the Upload certificate option] At the Upload certificate step of the wizard, browse to the certificate that you want to install, and provide a password for the certificate file if required.
