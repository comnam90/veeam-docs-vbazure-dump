# Accessing Web UI from Workstation


To access Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure Web UI from a workstation, navigate to the Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure web address in a web browser. The address consists of a public IPv4 address or DNS hostname of the backup appliance. Note that the website is available over HTTPS only.

|  |
| --- |
| Important |
| Consider the following:   * If you backup appliance is deployed without a public IP address, you must enable the private network deployment functionality for the appliance. For more information, see [Working in Private Environments](app_private_network.md). * Internet Explorer is not supported. To access the Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure Web UI, use Microsoft Edge (latest version), Mozilla Firefox (latest version) or Google Chrome (latest version). |

You can access Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure using a local user account or a user account of an external identity provider. To learn how to add user accounts to Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure, see [Adding User Accounts](user_account_add.md).

| Note |
| The web browser may display a warning notifying that the connection is untrusted. To eliminate the warning, you can replace the TLS certificate that is currently used to secure traffic between the browser and the backup appliance with a trusted TLS certificate. To learn how to replace certificates, see [Replacing Security Certificates](working_with_certificates.md). |
