# Adding User Accounts


To manage access to Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure, you can create local user accounts or add user accounts of your identity provider. To be able to retrieve user identities from the identity provider, you must first [configure single sign-on settings](configuring_sso.md).

To add a Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure user account, do the following:

1. Switch to the Configuration page.
2. Navigate to Accounts > Portal Users.
3. Click Add.

1. Complete the Add User wizard.

1. At the Type step of the wizard, choose whether you want to create a new Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure user or to retrieve a user identity from your identity provider.

1. At the Name step of the wizard, specify a name and description for the user account.

The maximum length of the account name is 32 characters. An account name can contain only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. A description can contain only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, numeric characters, dots, commas and spaces.
