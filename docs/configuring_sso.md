Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure supports single sign-on (SSO) authentication based on the SAML 2.0 protocol. SSO authentication scheme allows a user to log in to different software systems with the same credentials using the identity provider service. For Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure to be able to authenticate users whose identity has been received from an identity provider, you must perform a number of configuration actions both in the Veeam Backup for Microsoft Azure Web UI and on the identity provider side.
